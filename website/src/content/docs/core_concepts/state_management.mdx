State management is a critical aspect of any application.
It allows you to manage the state of your application, and facilitates seamless tracking and handling of changes to it.

Reactter provides a variety of mechanisms for state management, including classes, hooks, and methods:

- Classes
  - <HT>[`Signal`](/reactter/classes/signal)</HT>
- Hooks
  - <HT>[`UseState`](/reactter/hooks/use_state)</HT>
  - <HT>[`UseAsyncState`](/reactter/hooks/use_async_state)</HT>
  - <HT>[`UseReducer`](/reactter/hooks/use_reducer)</HT>
  - <HT>[`UseCompute`](/reactter/hooks/use_compute)</HT>
- Methods
  - <HM>[`Reactter.lazyState`](/reactter/methods/state_management_methods/#reactterlazy_state)</HM>
  - <HM>[`Reactter.batch`](/reactter/methods/state_management_methods/#reactterbatch)</HM>
  - <HM>[`Reactter.untracked`](/reactter/methods/state_management_methods/#reactteruntracked)</HM>

## How it works

Reactter's state management system is based on the concept of _reactivity_.
Contrary to the prevailing notion that implementing reactive programming in Dart can be challenging,
Reactter greatly simplifies this process.
To dive into the concept, let's start by exploring what constitutes a state in Reactter.

### State

All state in Reactter are classes that inherit <HT><a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/ReactterState-class.html" target="_blank">`ReactterState`</a></HT>,
which encapsulates the data and behavior of a particular state, and provides a way to notify observers when the state changes.

Reactter offers two fundamental approaches for creating states: <HT>[`Signal`](/reactter/classes/signal)</HT> and <HT>[`Hooks`](/reactter/core_concepts/hooks)</HT>.

### State methods

<HT><a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/ReactterState-class.html" target="_blank">`ReactterState`</a></HT> class provides some methods for managing states, which are:

<StateMethods />

### Example

Let's see an example of how a <HT>`Signal`</HT> state is used and what happens under the hood.

```dart title="main.dart" /(Signal)(?!\u0060)/ /count(?!down)(?!\u0060)/ "count.value" "Reactter.on" "Lifecycle.didUpdate"
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';

// Create a reactive state called `count` using the `Signal` class
final count = Signal(10);

void main() async {
  // Listen to the `didUpdate` event of the `count` state
  // and print the `value` of `count` each time it changes
  Reactter.on(
    count,
    Lifecycle.didUpdate,
    (_, __) => print('Count: $count')
  );

  // Create a timer that decrements the `value` of `count`
  // by 1 every second until it reaches 0
  await Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), countdown);
}

// Decrement the `value` of `count` by 1 each time the timer ticks
// and cancel the `timer` when the `value` of `count` reaches 0
void countdown(Timer timer) {
  count.value -= 1;

  if (count.value == 0) {
    timer.cancel();
  }
}
```

During the process, as the `value` of `count` changes and triggers the <HE>`Lifecycle.didUpdate`</HE> event,
internally within the <HT>`Signal`</HT> class, the <HM>`update`</HM> method is invoked to notify its listeners(in line 11 of the code below), as follows:

```dart title="signal.dart" "ReactterState" "_value" "update"
class Signal<T> extends ReactterState[...] {
  T _value;

  Signal(this._value);

  T get value => _value;

  set value(T val) {
    if (_value == val) return;

    update((_) => _value = val);
  }

  [...]
}
```
