State management is a critical aspect of any application, as it is responsible for controlling and maintaining data consistency over time.
It facilitates updating and tracking changes in the state, ensuring a smooth user experience and stable application operation.

At Reactter, we understand the importance of state management, which is why we have designed a state management system that is efficient, reactive, and easy to use.

To continue, we will show you the mechanisms that Reactter offers for state management and how they work.

## API

Reactter provides a variety of mechanisms for state management, including classes, hooks, and methods:

- Mixins
  - <HT>[`RtStateBase`](/reactter/classes/RtStateBase)</HT>
- Classes
  - <HT>[`Signal`](/reactter/classes/signal)</HT>
- Hooks
  - <HT>[`UseState`](/reactter/hooks/use_state)</HT>
  - <HT>[`UseAsyncState`](/reactter/hooks/use_async_state)</HT>
  - <HT>[`UseReducer`](/reactter/hooks/use_reducer)</HT>
  - <HT>[`UseCompute`](/reactter/hooks/use_compute)</HT>
- Methods
  - <HM>[`Rt.lazyState`](/reactter/methods/state_management_methods/#rtlazy_state)</HM>
  - <HM>[`Rt.batch`](/reactter/methods/state_management_methods/#rtbatch)</HM>
  - <HM>[`Rt.untracked`](/reactter/methods/state_management_methods/#rtuntracked)</HM>

## How it works

Reactter's state management system is based on the concept of _reactivity_.
Contrary to the prevailing notion that implementing reactive programming in Dart can be challenging,
Reactter greatly simplifies this process.
To dive into the concept, let's start by exploring what constitutes a state in Reactter.

### State

All states in Reactter are classes that inherit <HT><a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/RtState-class.html" target="_blank">`RtState`</a></HT>,
which encapsulates the data and behavior of a particular state, and provides a way to notify observers when the state changes.

Reactter offers three fundamental approaches for creating states: <HT>[`RtStateBase`](/reactter/classes/RtStateBase)</HT>, <HT>[`Signal`](/reactter/classes/signal)</HT> and <HT>[`Hooks`](/reactter/core_concepts/hooks)</HT>.

### State methods

<HT><a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/RtState-class.html" target="_blank">`RtState`</a></HT> class provides some methods for managing states, which are:

<StateMethods />

### Example

Let's see an countdown example using <HT>`Signal`</HT> and understand what happens under the hood.

```dart title="main.dart" /(Signal)(?!\u0060)/ /count(?!down)(?!\u0060)/ "count.value" "Rt.on" "Lifecycle.didUpdate"
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';

// Create a reactive state called `count` using the `Signal` class
final count = Signal(10);

void main() async {
  // Liste  n to the `didUpdate` event of the `count` state
  // and print the `value` of `count` each time it changes
  Rt.on(
    count,
    Lifecycle.didUpdate,
    (_, __) => print('Count: $count')
  );

  // Create a timer that invoked the `countdown` function every second
  await Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), countdown);
}

// Decrement the `value` of `count` by 1 each time the timer ticks
// and cancel the `timer` when the `value` of `count` reaches 0
void countdown(Timer timer) {
  count.value -= 1;

  if (count.value == 0) {
    timer.cancel();
  }
}
```
Ahora veamos que contiene la clase <HT>`Signal`</HT> y c√≥mo se actualiza el estado `count` en el ejemplo anterior.

Now let's see what the <HT>`Signal`</HT> class contains and how the `count` state is updated in the example above.

```dart title="signal.dart" "RtContextMixin" "Rt.createState" "RtStateBase" "_value" "update"
class Signal<T> with RtContextMixin, RtStateBase<Signal<T>> {
  // State value
  T _value;

  // Private constructor, only a `Signal` instance can be created through the factory.
  Signal._(this._value);

  factory Signal(T value) {
    // Register a new state in the Reactter context
    return Rt.createState(
      () => Signal._(value),
    );
  }

  T get value => _value;

  set value(T val) {
    if (_value == val) return;

    // Notify listeners that the state has changed,
    // triggering the `Lifecycle.willUpdate` and `Lifecycle.didUpdate` events in order.
    update((_) => _value = val);
  }

  [...]
}
```

During the process, as the `value` of `count` changes, the <HE>`Lifecycle.didUpdate`</HE> event is triggered, which is fired by the <HM>`update`</HM> method(`signal.dart`, line 22).
This event is listened to by the <HM>`Rt.on`</HM> method(`main.dart`, line 10), which prints the `value` of `count`.

This occurs thanks to the reactivity of Reactter, which is responsible for notifying listeners by emitting events related to the **_lifecycle_** of the state.
