With Reactter, managing objects becomes straightforward. You can create, delete, and access desired objects from a single centralized location, accessible from anywhere in your code, all thanks to Reactter's robust dependency injection system.

Dependency injection offers several benefits.

- **Inversion of Control**: It adheres to the principle of inversion of control, where the responsibility for object creation and management is delegated to Reactter. This results in improved code modularity, reusability, and testability.
- **Simplified Code**: By offloading the responsibility of creating dependencies from individual classes, dependency injection simplifies code, allowing classes to focus more on their core functionality.

Reactter provides the following dependencies injection mechanisms:

- Hooks
  - [`UseInstance`](/reactter/hooks/UseInstance)
- Methods
  - [`Reactter.register`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/register)
  - [`Reactter.lazyBuilder`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/lazy_builder)
  - [`Reactter.lazyFactory`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/lazy_factory)
  - [`Reactter.lazySingleton`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/lazy_singleton)

  - [`Reactter.factory`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/factory)
  - [`Reactter.singleton`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/singleton)
  - [`Reactter.get`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/get)
  - [`Reactter.delete`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/delete)
  - [`Reactter.unregister`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/unregister)
  - [`Reactter.destroy`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/destroy)
  - [`Reactter.find`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/find)
  - [`Reactter.isRegistered`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/is_registered)

## How it works

Reactter manages the dependencies through a centralized mechanism.
This core component serves as a central repository for registering, resolving, and providing dependencies across the app.
To comprehend this mechanism thoroughly, let's break down the process into five stages:

1. **Registration**: This stage involves registering the dependency into Reactter's context with the specified `id` and `mode` params.

    For this, you can use the following methods:
      - [`Reactter.register`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/register)
      - [`Reactter.lazyBuilder`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/lazy_builder)(registers with `builder` mode)
      - [`Reactter.lazyFactory`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/lazy_factory)(registers with `factory` mode)
      - [`Reactter.lazySingleton`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/lazy_singleton)(registers with `singleton` mode)

    The `Lifecycle.registered` event is emitted.

2. **Resolving**: When there is a request for getting a dependency, Reactter gets it according to `id` and the `mode` through the registry.
If the dependency with/without `id` is not yet created, Reactter initializes it based on registry(this condition doesn't apply to `find` method).

    For this, you can use the following methods:
      - [`Reactter.get`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/get)
      - [`Reactter.find`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/find)(doesn't create the instance)
      - [`Reactter.create`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/create)(registers if not found in registry)
      - [`Reactter.builder`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/builder)(registers with `builder` mode if not found in registry)
      - [`Reactter.factory`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/factory)(registers with `factory` mode if not found in registry)
      - [`Reactter.singleton`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/singleton)(registers with `singleton` mode if not found in registry)

    The following events are fired(only if the dependency is created):
      - `Lifecycle.initialized`
      - `Lifecycle.willMount`
      - `Lifecycle.didMount`

3. **Usage**: The dependency is then used across the app as needed.

    Some of these events may occur:
      - `Lifecycle.willUpdate`
      - `Lifecycle.didUpdate`

4. **Deleting**: When the dependency with/without `id` is no longer required, Reactter destroys it.

    For this, you can use the following methods:
      - [`Reactter.delete`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/delete)
      - [`Reactter.destroy`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/destroy)(delete & unregister)

    The following events are fired:
      - `Lifecycle.willUnmount`
      - `Lifecycle.didUnmount`
      - `Lifecycle.destroyed`

5. **Unregistration**: When the dependency with/without `id` is no longer required and depending on `mode`, Reactter unregisters it.

    For this, you can use the following methods:
      - [`Reactter.unregister`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/unregister)
      - [`Reactter.delete`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/delete)
      - [`Reactter.destroy`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/destroy)

    The `Lifecycle.unregistered` event is emitted.

:::note
`id` and `mode` are optional parameters.

If `id` is not provided, Reactter will resolve the dependency based on the type of the class only.

If `mode` is not provided, Reactter will use the default mode, which is `InstanceManageMode.builder`.

:::note
A **dependency** in Reactter is referred to as an **instance** of specific type.

### Example

To understand it better, we will return to the countdown example seen from the [State Management](/reactter/core_concepts/state_management/#example) page,
but now using the dependency injection:

```dart title="counter.dart" /((_*)count)(?!down)(?!er)(?!\u0060)/ "count.value" "Reactter.on" "Lifecycle.didUpdate"
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';

/// A class that represents a counter with a count state
class Counter {
  final Signal<int> _count;

  int get count => _count.value;

  const Counter(int initialValue) : _count = Signal(initialValue);

  void decrement() => _count.value -= 1;
}
```

```dart title="countdown.dart" "UseInstance.create" "Reactter.delete" "Reactter.on" "counter.count" "counter.decrement" "uCounter" "uCounter.instance" /Counter(?!\u0060)/ /(counter)[, ]/ "Lifecycle.didUpdate"
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';
import 'counter.dart';

/// A class that represents a countdown using a counter
class Countdown {
  // Create an instance of the `Counter` class using the `UseInstance` hook
  // and initialize it with an initial value of 10
  final uCounter = UseInstance.create<Counter>(() => Counter(10));

  // Get the instance of the `Counter` class
  Counter get counter => uCounter.instance;

  /// Start the countdown
  Future<void> run() {
    // Listen to the `didUpdate` event of the `counter` instance
    // and print the current `value` of `count` each time it changes
    Reactter.on(
      counter,
      Lifecycle.didUpdate,
      (_, __) => print('Count: ${counter.count}'),
    );

    // Create a timer that decrements the `count` state by 1
    // every second until it reaches 0
    return Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), _countdown);
  }

  // Decrement the `count` state by 1 each time the timer ticks
  // and delete the `Counter` instance when the count value reaches 0
  void _countdown(Timer timer) {
    counter.decrement();

    if (counter.count == 0) {
      timer.cancel();
      Reactter.delete<Counter>();
    }
  }
}
```

```dart title="main.dart" "Reactter.create" /Countdown(?!\u0060)/ /(countdown) =/ "countdown.run"
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';
import 'countdown.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create an instance of the `Countdown` class
  final countdown = Reactter.create(() => Countdown())!;
  // Start the countdown
  await countdown.run();
}
```

In this example, we have create a countdown of 10 seconds, and when it reaches 0, the `Counter` instance is deleted.
But we will make a small tweak to change the countdown behavior.

```dart title="main.dart" ins={3, 6-7} collapse={8-11} "Reactter.register" "Reactter.create" /Counter(?!\u0060)/ /Countdown(?!\u0060)/ /(countdown) =/ "countdown.run"
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';
import 'countdown.dart';
import 'counter.dart';

void main() async {
  // Register the `Counter` class with an initial value of 20
  Reactter.register(() => Counter(20));
  // Create an instance of the `Countdown` class
  final countdown = Reactter.create(() => Countdown())!;
  // Start the countdown
  await countdown.run();
}
```

Now, the countdown will start from 20 and when it reaches 0, the `Counter` instance is deleted.
What happens is that the `Counter` instance is registered with an initial value of 20,
and when the `Countdown` instance is created, it uses the `Counter` instance registered.

Ok, but what if we want to use the `Counter` instance in another part of the code? Let's look:

```dart title="main.dart" ins={12-15} collapse={6-11} "Reactter.register" "Reactter.create" "Reactter.get" /counter(?!\\.)/ "counter?.count" /Counter(?!\u0060)(?! )/ /Countdown(?!\u0060)/ /(countdown) =/ "countdown.run"
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';
import 'countdown.dart';
import 'counter.dart';

void main() async {
  // Register the `Counter` class with an initial value of 20
  Reactter.register(() => Counter(20));
  // Create an instance of the `Countdown` class
  final countdown = Reactter.create(() => Countdown())!;
  // Start the countdown
  await countdown.run();
  // Get the instance of the `Counter` class
  final counter = Reactter.get<Counter>();
  // Try to print the current count value
  print('Count: ${counter?.count ?? 'Counter instance not found'}');
}
```
In this case, the countdown will work as before, but when trying to get the `Counter` instance to print its value,
the ouput will be _“Counter instance not found”_.
This occurs because `Counter` was registered as `InstanceManageMode.builder`(the default mode),
so when it was deleted at the end of the countdown its registration was also deleted.
If we want to get the `Counter` instance to print its value, we need to register using the `InstanceManageMode.singleton` mode.

Let's now delve into the **modes** of dependency registration.

The **mode** with which a dependency is registered determines how it is managed by Reactter. There are three modes:

- [Builder](#builder)
- [Factory](#factory)
- [Singleton](#singleton)

## Builder

Builder is a ways to manage an instance,
which registers a builder function and creates the instance,
unless it has already done so.

In builder mode, when the dependency tree no longer needs it,
it is completely deleted,
including unregistration (deleting the builder function).

Reactter identifies the builder mode as
<a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/6.0.0/InstanceManageMode/InstanceManageMode.builder.html" target="_blank">`InstanceManageMode.builder`</a>
and it's using for default.

:::note
  **Builder** uses less RAM than [Factory](#factory) and [Singleton](#singleton),
  but it consumes more CPU than the other modes.
:::

## Factory

Factory is a ways to manage an instance,
which registers a builder function only once
and creates the instance if not already done.

In factory mode, when the dependency tree no longer needs it,
the instance is deleted and the builder function is kept in the register.

Reactter identifies the factory mode as
<a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/6.0.0/InstanceManageMode/InstanceManageMode.factory.html" target="_blank">`InstanceManageMode.factory`</a>
and to active it,set it in the `mode` argument of [`Reactter.register`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/register) and [`Reactter.create`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/create),
or use [`Reactter.lazyFactory`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/lazy_factory),  [`Reactter.factory`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/factory).

:::note
  **Factory** uses more RAM than [Builder](#builder)
  but not more than [Singleton](#singleton),
  and consumes more CPU than [Singleton](#singleton)
  but not more than [Builder](#builder).
:::

## Singleton

Singleton is a ways to manage an instance,
which registers a builder function and creates the instance only once.

The singleton mode preserves the instance and its states,
even if the dependency tree stops using it.

Reactter identifies the singleton mode as
<a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/6.0.0/InstanceManageMode/InstanceManageMode.singleton.html" target="_blank">`InstanceManageMode.singleton`</a>
and to active it,
set it in the `mode` argument of [`Reactter.register`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/register) and [`Reactter.create`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/create),
or use [`Reactter.lazySingleton`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/lazy_singleton), [`Reactter.singleton`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/singleton).

:::note
  **Singleton** consumes less CPU than [Builder](#builder) and [Factory](#factory),
  but uses more RAM than the other modes.
:::

:::note
  Use [`Reactter.destroy`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_instance/destroy) if you want to force destroy the instance and its register.
