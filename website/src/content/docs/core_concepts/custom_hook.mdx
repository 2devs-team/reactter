Custom hooks are classes that extend <a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/ReactterHook-class.html" target="_blank">`ReactterHook`</a> that follow a special naming convention with the `use` prefix and can contain state logic, effects or any other custom code.


There are several advantages to using Custom Hooks:

- **Reusability**: to use the same hook again and again, without the need to write it twice.
- **Clean Code**: extracting part of code into a hook will provide a cleaner codebase.
- **Maintainability**: easier to maintain. if you need to change the logic of the hook, you only need to change it once.

## ReactterHook

The <a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/ReactterHook-class.html" target="_blank">`ReactterHook`</a> class provides a set of methods to manage the state and lifecycle of the hook:

<StateMethods />

## Example

Here's an example of counter hook that increments and decrements a value:

```dart title="use_count.dart"
class UseCount extends ReactterHook {
  final $ = ReactterHook.$register;

  int _count = 0;
  int get value => _count;

  UseCount(int initial) : _count = initial;

  void increment() => update(() => _count += 1);
  void decrement() => update(() => _count -= 1);
}
```

:::caution[Attention!!]
To create a custom hook(`ReactterHook`), you need to register it by adding the following line:

```dart showLineNumbers=false
final $ = ReactterHook.$register;
```

It's important to note that the states and hooks defined above this line are not linked to the hook.
To avoid this, it's recommended to place this line as the first line in the class body.
:::

You can then call that custom hook from anywhere in the code and get access to its shared logic:

```dart title="my_controller.dart"
class MyController {
  final count = UseCount(0);

  MyController() {
    Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (_) => count.increment());

    // Print count value every second
    Reactter.on(
      count,
      Lifecycle.didUpdate,
      (_, __) => print("Count: ${count.value}",
    );
  }
}
```
