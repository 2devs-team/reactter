In Reactter, event handler plays a pivotal role in facilitating seamless communication
and coordination between various components within the application.
Designed to ensure efficient state management and dependency injection,
fostering a cohesive ecosystem where different parts of the application can interact harmoniously.

Reactter offers the following event handler mechanisms:

- Hooks
  - [`UseEffect`](/reactter/hooks/UseEffect)
- Methods
  - [`Reactter.on`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_event/on)
  - [`Reactter.one`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_event/one)
  - [`Reactter.off`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_event/off)
  - [`Reactter.offAll`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_event/offAll)
  - [`Reactter.emit`](/reactter/methods/to_manage_event/emit)

## How it works

Event handler in Reactter is based on a few fundamental concepts:

- **Event**: Is a enum that represents a specific action or occurrence in the application.
- **Instance**: Is an object that emits and listens to events.
- **Listener**: Is a function that is executed when an event is emitted.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively managing event-driven interactions in Reactter apps.

### Example

To illustrate this, let's take a countdown example seen from the [State Management](/reactter/core_concepts/state_management/#example) page:

```dart title="main.dart" {10-14} /count(?!down)(?!\u0060)/ "count.value" "Reactter.on" "Lifecycle.didUpdate"
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';

// Create a reactive state called `count` using the `Signal` class
final count = Signal(10);

void main() async {
  // Listen to the `didUpdate` event of the `count` state
  // and print the `value` of `count` each time it changes
  Reactter.on(
    count,
    Lifecycle.didUpdate,
    (_, __) => print('Count: $count')
  );

  // Create a timer that decrements the `value` of `count`
  // by 1 every second until it reaches 0
  await Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), countdown);
}

// Decrement the `value` of `count` by 1 each time the timer ticks
// and cancel the `timer` when the `value` of `count` reaches 0
void countdown(Timer timer) {
  count.value -= 1;

  if (count.value == 0) {
    timer.cancel();
  }
}
```

In this example, the line 10 to 14, we see that the `Reactter.on` method is used to subscribe to the `Lifecycle.didUpdate` **event** of the `count` **instance**.
Whenever the `count` state changes, the **listener** function is invoked, printing the current `value` of the `count` state.

Here, we can't see the emitter, because it's encapsulated within the `Signal` class, and it's called when the `value` of the `count` state changes.
This mechanism is made possible by the underlying state management system.

Now, we do a small tweak to add an emitter:

```dart title="main.dart" ins={4,18-24,38-39} /count(?!down)(?!\u0060)/ "count.value" "Reactter.on" "Lifecycle.didUpdate" "Reactter.emit" /(CustomEvent) / /(CustomEvent(\.countdownFinished))(?!\u0060)/
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';

enum CustomEvent { countdownFinished }

// Create a reactive state called `count` using the `Signal` class
final count = Signal(10);

void main() async {
  // Listen to the `didUpdate` event of the `count` state
  // and print the `value` of `count` each time it changes
  Reactter.on(
    count,
    Lifecycle.didUpdate,
    (_, __) => print('Count: $count')
  );

  // Listen to the `countdownFinished` event
  // and print a message when the countdown is finished
  Reactter.on(
    count,
    CustomEvent.countdownFinished,
    (_, __) => print('Countdown finished!')
  );

  // Create a timer that decrements the `value` of `count`
  // by 1 every second until it reaches 0
  await Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), countdown);
}

// Decrement the `value` of `count` by 1 each time the timer ticks
// and cancel the `timer` when the `value` of `count` reaches 0
void countdown(Timer timer) {
  count.value -= 1;

  if (count.value == 0) {
    timer.cancel();
    // Emit the `CustomEvent.countdownFinished` event
    Reactter.emit(count, CustomEvent.countdownFinished);
  }
}
```

We added a new **event** called `CustomEvent.countdownFinished` and a new **listener** that prints a message when the countdown is finished.
When the countdown reaches 0, the `count` **instance** emits the `CustomEvent.countdownFinished` event, and the **listener** function is invoked, printing the message.

This example demonstrates how the event handler system in Reactter enables seamless communication between different parts of the application,
facilitating efficient coordination and interaction.
