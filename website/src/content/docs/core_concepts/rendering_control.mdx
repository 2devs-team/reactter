In Flutter, efficient rendering control is essential for crafting high-performance, responsive, and scalable applications.
Reactter provides a way to easily control the rendering of components in the widget tree behavior effortlessly, using the `flutter_reactter` package.
This package provides a collection of `Widgets` and some `BuildContext` methods:

- Widgets
  - `ReactterScope`
  - `ReactterWatcher`
  - `ReactterProvider`
  - `ReactterProviders`
  - `ReactterConsumer`
  - `ReactterSelector`
  - `ReactterComponent`
- `BuildContext` methods
  - `use`
  - `watch`
  - `watchId`
  - `select`

## How it works

The rendering control in Reactter is based on two core concepts of Flutter:

- **InheritedWidget**: This powerful mechanism efficiently shares data across the widget tree.
Reactter extends this capability with the `ReactterProvider` widget, which stores dependencies using the dependency injection system.
This allows descendant widgets to access these dependencies as needed.
- **BuildContext Methods**: These methods facilitate dependency access and rendering control within the widget tree.
Reactter widgets like `ReactterConsumer`, `ReactterSelector`, and `ReactterComponent` use these methods to observe dependencies or states.
Whenever the dependency or any observed state undergoes a change, these widgets promptly trigger the rebuilding of the widget tree to reflect the updated state.

## Example

Let's create a simple counter app using Reactter to demonstrate how to control the rendering of the widget tree in Flutter.

```dart title="main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: CounterApp(),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart title="counter.dart"
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';

class Counter {
  final count = Signal(0);

  void increment() {
    count.value++;
  }

  void decrement() {
    count.value--;
  }
}
```

```dart title="counter_app.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_reactter/flutter_reactter.dart';

class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const CounterPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ReactterProvider<Counter>(
      () => Counter(),
      builder: (context, counter, child) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: const Text("Counter"),
          ),
          body: Row(
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: counter.decrement,
                child: Icon(Icons.remove),
              ),
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: ReactterConsumer<Counter>(
                  listenStates: (counter) => [counter.count],
                  builder: (context, counter, child) {
                    return Text("${counter.count}");
                  },
                ),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: counter.increment,
                child: Icon(Icons.add),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we have done the following:
- We have created a `Counter` class with a `count` property that is a `Signal` object.
The `Signal` object is a reactive object that notifies its listeners when its value changes.
- We have also created a `CounterPage` widget that uses the `ReactterProvider` widget to provide the `Counter` dependency to its descendant widgets.
- The `ReactterConsumer` widget observes the `count` property of the `Counter` object and rebuilds the widget tree when the `count` value changes.

Now, when you run the app, you will see a counter app with two buttons to increment and decrement the counter value.

In this scenario, only the `text` widget will be rebuilt when the `count` value changes, not the entire widget tree.
This is because the `ReactterConsumer` widget observes the `count` property and triggers the rebuilding of the widget tree when the `count` value changes.

In example, we used the `ReactterConsumer` widget to observe the `count` property of the `Counter` object,
but we can do the same functionality by using the `watch` method of the `BuildContext` class.

Here's how we can refactor the code to use the `watch` method along with a `Builder` widget to achieve the same outcome:

```dart title="counter_app.dart" ins={27-33} del={24-26}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_reactter/flutter_reactter.dart';

class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const CounterPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ReactterProvider<Counter>(
      () => Counter(),
      builder: (context, counter, child) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: const Text("Counter"),
          ),
          body: Row(
            children: [
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: counter.decrement,
                child: Icon(Icons.remove),
              ),
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: ReactterConsumer<Counter>(
                  listenStates: (counter) => [counter.count],
                  builder: (context, counter, child) {
                child: Builder(
                  builder: (context) {
                    final counter = context.watch<Counter>(
                      (counter) => [counter.count],
                    );

                    return Text("${counter.count}");
                  },
                ),
              ),
              ElevatedButton(
                onPressed: counter.increment,
                child: Icon(Icons.add),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Although the `watch` method can be directly employed within the builder method of the `ReactterProvider` widget,
it's advisable to utilize it alongside a `Builder` widget to prevent unnecessary rebuilds of the widget tree.
This practice leverages the `BuildContext` scope, offering a more granular approach to rendering control within the widget tree.

For more advanced use cases, you can employ other Reactter widgets and `BuildContext` methods to further refine the rendering control of the widget tree.
By embracing these strategies, you can optimize the performance and efficiency of your Flutter applications while ensuring a seamless user experience.
