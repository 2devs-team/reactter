Hooks are classes that extend [`ReactterHook`](https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/ReactterHook-class.html), follow a special naming convention with the `use` prefix and can contain state logic, effects or any other custom code.

Reactter provider some hooks to manage the state and side effects of the application, such as:

- [`UseState`](/reactter/hooks/use_state)
- [`UseAsyncState`](/reactter/hooks/use_async_state)
- [`UseReducer`](/reactter/hooks/use_reducer)
- [`UseCompute`](/reactter/hooks/use_compute)
- [`UseEffect`](/reactter/hooks/use_effect)
- [`UseInstance`](/reactter/hooks/use_instance)

## Custom hook

Reactter provides a way to create custom hooks to encapsulate logic that can be reused across the application.

There are several advantages to using Custom Hooks:

- **Reusability**: to use the same hook again and again, without the need to write it twice.
- **Clean Code**: extracting part of code into a hook will provide a cleaner codebase.
- **Maintainability**: easier to maintain. if you need to change the logic of the hook, you only need to change it once.


### Creating a custom hook

To create a custom hook, you need to create a class that extends `ReactterHook` and follow the naming convention with the `use` prefix.

Here's an example of a custom hook that increments and decrements a value:

```dart title="use_count.dart" "ReactterHook" "ReactterHook.$register" {"* This line is REQUIRED!!":4-5} "update" "_count"
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';

class UseCount extends ReactterHook {

  final $ = ReactterHook.$register;

  int _count = 0;
  int get value => _count;

  UseCount(int initial) : _count = initial;

  void increment() => update(() => _count += 1);
  void decrement() => update(() => _count -= 1);
}
```

In above example, we have used the `update` method to update the value of the `_count` variable.
This methods is a part of the `ReactterHook` class that allows you to update the state of the hook.

:::note
`ReactterHook` is a class that inherits from `ReactterState`.
It provides a set of methods to manage the state and lifecycle of the hook.
Learn more about [State methods](/reactter/core_concepts/state_management/#state-methods).
:::

:::caution[Attention!!]
To create a custom hook(`ReactterHook`), you need to register it by adding the following line:

```dart showLineNumbers=false
final $ = ReactterHook.$register;
```

It's important to note that the states and hooks defined above this line are not linked to the hook.
To avoid this, it's recommended to place this line as the first line in the class body.

### Using a custom hook

You can then call that custom hook from anywhere in the code and get access to its shared logic:

```dart title="my_controller.dart" "Reactter.on" "Lifecycle.didUpdate" "UseCount" /count(?! )(?!.dart)/ "count.value" "count.increment"
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';
import 'use_count.dart';

class MyController {
  final count = UseCount(0);

  MyController() {
    Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (_) => count.increment());

    // Print count value every second
    Reactter.on(
      count,
      Lifecycle.didUpdate,
      (_, __) => print("Count: ${count.value}",
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `MyController` class uses the `UseCount` custom hook to manage the state of the `count` variable.
The `count` variable is initialized with an initial value of `0` and is incremented by `1` every second using a timer.
The `didUpdate` event of the `count` state is subscribed to, and the current value of the `count` state is printed every second.
