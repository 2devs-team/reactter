Hooks are classes with the ability to use states and manage side effects. They are a fundamental concept in Reactter and are used to encapsulate logic that can be reused across the application.

## API

Reactter provider some hooks to manage the state and side effects of the application, which are:

- <HT>[`UseState`](/reactter/hooks/use_state)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseAsyncState`](/reactter/hooks/use_async_state)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseReducer`](/reactter/hooks/use_reducer)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseCompute`](/reactter/hooks/use_compute)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseEffect`](/reactter/hooks/use_effect)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseDependency`](/reactter/hooks/use_instance)</HT>

## How it works

Hooks in Reactter are classes that extend <HT><a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/RtHook-class.html" target="_blank">`RtHook`</a></HT> and follow a special naming convention with the  <HT>`Use`</HT>  prefix. The <HT>`RtHook`</HT> class is responsible for binding the hook to other hooks and states, and managing the lifecycle of the hook.

Hooks in Reactter are essentially stateful entities because <HT>`RtHook`</HT> inherits from <HT>`RtState`</HT> this inheritance allows hooks to manage both state and lifecycle methods efficiently.

To manage these aspects, Hooks provide the following:
<StateMethodsLite/>

## Custom hook

Reactter provides a way to create _**Custom Hooks**_ to encapsulate logic that can be reused across the application.

There are several advantages to using _**Custom Hooks**_:

- **Reusability**: to use the same hook again and again, without the need to write it twice.
- **Clean Code**: extracting part of code into a hook will provide a cleaner codebase.
- **Maintainability**: easier to maintain. if you need to change the logic of the hook, you only need to change it once.

### Creating a custom hook

To create a _**Custom hook**_, you need to create a class that extends <HT>`RtHook`</HT> and follow the naming convention with the <HT>`Use`</HT> prefix.

:::note
<HT>`RtHook`</HT> is a class that inherits from <HT>`RtState`</HT>.
It provides a set of methods to manage the state and lifecycle of the hook.
Learn more about [State methods](/reactter/core_concepts/state_management/#state-methods).
:::

Here's an example of a _**Custom Hook**_ that manages the state of a text input:

<Code code={UseTextInputCode} lang="dart" mark={[...marks, {range: "5-6", label: "*      This line is REQUIRED!        "}]} />

:::caution[Attention!!]
To create a _**Custom Hook**_(<HT>`RtHook`</HT>), you need to register it by adding the following line:

```dart showLineNumbers=false
final $ = RtHook.$register;
```

It's important to note that the states and hooks defined above this line are not linked to the hook.
To avoid this, it's recommended to place this line as the first line in the class body.
:::

As shown in the example above, we can utilize other hooks such as <HT>[`UseEffect`](/reactter/hooks/use_effect)</HT> to monitor changes in the text input's controller and ensure it is disposed when the hook is destroyed.

The <HM>`update`</HM> method is used to set the internal `_value` to the current text in the controller, which keeps the state synchronized with the input.
This methods is a part of the <HT>`RtHook`</HT> class that allows you to update the state of the hook.

### Using a custom hook

You can then call that _**Custom Hook**_ from anywhere in the code and get access to its shared logic:

<CodeTabs>
  <ZappButton path="examples/custom_hook"/>

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem>
      <HM single slot="label">my_controller.dart</HM>
      <Code code={MyControllerCode} lang="dart" mark={[...marks, {range: "5-6"}, 11, 12]}/>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem>
      <HM single slot="label">my_custom_form.dart</HM>
      <Code code={MyCustomFormCode} lang="dart" mark={[...marks, 43, 49]}/>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="use_text_input.dart">
      <Code code={UseTextInputCode} lang="dart" mark={[...marks]}/>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="main.dart">
      <Code code={MainCode} lang="dart" mark={marks} />
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</CodeTabs>

In the example above, the form captures first and last name inputs, combines them into a full name, and displays the result.
<HT>`MyController`</HT> uses <HT>`UseTextInput`</HT> hook for capturing the first and last name.
The `fullName` state is defined using <HT>[`UseCompute`](/reactter/hooks/use_compute)</HT> to compute the full name based on the values of `firstNameInput` and `lastNameInput`. This ensures the full name is automatically updated whenever either input changes.
