Hooks are classes with the ability to use states and manage side effects. They are a fundamental concept in Reactter and are used to encapsulate logic that can be reused across the application.

## API

Reactter provides the following hooks:

- <HT>[`UseState`](/reactter/api/hooks/use_state)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseAsyncState`](/reactter/api/hooks/use_async_state)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseReducer`](/reactter/api/hooks/use_reducer)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseCompute`](/reactter/api/hooks/use_compute)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseEffect`](/reactter/api/hooks/use_effect)</HT>
- <HT>[`UseDependency`](/reactter/api/hooks/use_instance)</HT>

## How it works

Hooks in Reactter are classes that extend <HT>[`RtHook`](/reactter/api/classes/rt_hook)</HT> and follow a special naming convention with the  <HT>`Use`</HT>  prefix. The <HT>`RtHook`</HT> class is responsible for binding the hook to other hooks and states, and managing the lifecycle of the hook.

Hooks in Reactter are essentially stateful entities because <HT>[`RtHook`](/reactter/api/classes/rt_hook)</HT> inherits from <HT>`RtState`</HT> this inheritance allows hooks to manage both state and lifecycle methods efficiently.

To manage these aspects, Hooks provide the following:
<StatePropertiesMethodsRef/>

## Custom hook

Reactter provides a way to create _**custom hooks**_ to encapsulate logic that can be reused across the application.

There are several advantages to using _**custom hooks**_:

- **Reusability**: to use the same hook again and again, without the need to write it twice.
- **Clean Code**: extracting part of code into a hook will provide a cleaner codebase.
- **Maintainability**: easier to maintain. if you need to change the logic of the hook, you only need to change it once.
