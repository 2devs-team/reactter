This documentation assumes you've already read the [Lifecycle](/reactter/core_concepts/lifecycle/).
It's recommended read that first if you're new in Reactter.

<HT><a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/LifecycleObserver-class.html" target="_blank">`LifecycleObserver`</a></HT> is a class that provides a way to observe the lifecycle of a dependency. 

## Syntax

```dart showLineNumbers=false
abstract class LifecycleObserver {
  /// This method is called when the dependency instance is created.
  void onCreated() {}

  /// This method is called when the dependency is going to be mounted
  /// in the widget tree(exclusive to `flutter_reactter`).
  void onWillMount() {}

  /// This method is called when the dependency has been successfully mounted
  /// in the widget tree(exclusive to `flutter_reactter`).
  void onDidMount() {}

  /// This method is called when the dependency's state is about to be updated.
  /// The parameter is a [IState].
  void onWillUpdate(covariant IState? state) {}

  /// This method is called when the dependency's state has been updated.
  /// The parameter is a [IState].
  void onDidUpdate(covariant IState? state) {}

  /// This method is called when the dependency is going to be unmounted
  /// from the widget tree(exclusive to `flutter_reactter`).
  void onWillUnmount() {}

  /// This method is called when the dependency has been successfully unmounted
  /// from the widget tree(exclusive to `flutter_reactter`).
  void onDidUnmount() {}
}
```

## Example

Here's an example of a simple `LifecycleObserver`:

```dart
class MyDependency extends LifecycleObserver {
  @override
  void onCreated() {
    print('MyObserver created');
  }

  @override
  void onWillMount() {
    print('MyObserver will mount');
  }

  @override
  void onDidMount() {
    print('MyObserver did mount');
  }

  @override
  void onWillUpdate(RtState? state) {
    print('MyObserver will update with state: $state');
  }

  @override
  void onDidUpdate(RtState? state) {
    print('MyObserver did update with state: $state');
  }

  @override
  void onWillUnmount() {
    print('MyObserver will unmount');
  }

  @override
  void onDidUnmount() {
    print('MyObserver did unmount');
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `MyDependency` class extends `LifecycleObserver` and overrides all the lifecycle methods.
When an instance of `MyDependency` is created, the lifecycle methods are called in the order they are defined.
