import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";
import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import reactterVersion from "@/data/reactter_version";

Before anything, you need to be aware that Reactter is distributed on two packages:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/reactter" class="inline-block align-middle">
      <img class="min-w-28" src="https://img.shields.io/pub/v/reactter?color=1d7fac&amp;labelColor=29b6f6&amp;label=reactter&amp;logo=dart" alt="Reactter" />
    </a>
    <span>: </span>
    <span>The core package that contains the core functionalities of Reactter.

  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_reactter" class="inline-block align-middle">

## Installation

To follow this guide, youâ€™ll need an existing Dart/Flutter project. If you don't get one yet, head to https://dart.dev/get-dart to get started.

Once you have your project set up, proceed to install the package using one of the following methods:

- [Automatic installation](#automatic-installation)
- [Manual installation](#manual-installation)

### Automatic installation

Add the package on your project by running the following command:

<Tabs groupName="project_type">
  <TabItem name="dart" label="Only Dart" icon="dart">
    ```shell showLineNumbers=false
    dart pub add reactter
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="flutter" label="With Flutter" icon="flutter">
    ```shell showLineNumbers=false
    flutter pub add flutter_reactter
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Manual installation

Add the package on your project by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

<Tabs groupName="project_type">
  <TabItem name="dart" label="Only Dart" icon="dart">
    <Code
      title="pubspec.yaml"
      lang="yaml"
      showLineNumbers={false}
      code={`
dependencies:
  reactter: ${reactterVersion ? `^${reactterVersion}` : "# add version here"}
      `}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="flutter" label="With Flutter" icon="flutter">
    <Code
      title="pubspec.yaml"
      lang="yaml"
      showLineNumbers={false}
      code={`
dependencies:
  flutter_reactter: ${flutterReactterVersion ? `^${flutterReactterVersion}` : "# add version here"}
      `}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After adding the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file, run the following command to install the package:

<Tabs groupName="project_type">
  <TabItem name="dart" label="Only Dart" icon="dart">
    ```shell showLineNumbers=false
dart pub get
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="flutter" label="With Flutter" icon="flutter">
    ```shell showLineNumbers=false
flutter pub get
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Additional setup

This step is optional but recommended. Use the <span class="inline-block align-middle">[![Reactter Lint](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/reactter_lint?color=1d7fac&labelColor=29b6f6&label=reactter_lint&logo=dart)](https://pub.dev/packages/reactter_lint)</span> package to enforce best practices and conventions in your project:

```shell showLineNumbers=false
dart pub add reactter_lint
```

Additionally, if you're developing with Visual Studio Code, it is a good idea to use [Reactter Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CarLeonDev.reacttersnippets) for improving productivity.

## Usage

To use Reactter, you must import the package into your Dart file where you need it:

<Tabs groupName="project_type">
  <TabItem name="dart" label="Only Dart" icon="dart">
    ```dart
import 'package:reactter/reactter.dart';
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="flutter" label="With Flutter" icon="flutter">
    ```dart
import 'package:flutter_reactter/flutter_reactter.dart';
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it! You are now ready to use Reactter in your Dart/Flutter project.
