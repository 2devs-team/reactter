<HT><a href="https://pub.dev/documentation/reactter/latest/reactter/Signal-class.html" target="_blank">`Signal`</a></HT> is reactive state that encapsulate a `value` changing over time. When the `value` of a signal changes, it automatically notifies its observers.

## Syntax

```dart showLineNumbers=false
  Signal<T>(T initialValue);
```

<HT>`Signal`</HT> accepts this property:

- `initialValue`: Initial value of <HT>`T`</HT> type that the it will hold.

## Properties & Methods

<HT>`Signal`</HT> provides the following properties and methods:

- `value`: A getter/setter that allows to read and write its state.
<StateMethodsLite/>

## Usage

### Declaration

<HT>`Signal`</HT> can be initialized using the constructor class:

```dart showLineNumbers=false
final intSignal = Signal<int>(0);
final strSignal = Signal("initial value");
final userSignal = Signal(User());
```

### Reading and writing the value

<HT>`Signal`</HT> has a `value` property that allows to read and write its state:

```dart showLineNumbers=false ".value"
intSignal.value = 10;
print("Current state: ${intSignal.value}");
```

or also can use the callable function:

```dart showLineNumbers=false
intSignal(10);
print("Current state: ${intSignal()}");
```

or simply use <HM>`.toString()`</HM> implicit to get its `value` as String:

```dart showLineNumbers=false
print("Current state: $intSignal");
```

:::note
<HT>`Signal`</HT> notifies that its `value` has changed when the previous `value` is different from the current `value`.
If its `value` is an <HT>`Object`</HT>, it does not detect internal changes, only when `value` is setted to another <HT>`Object`</HT>.
:::

### Updating the value

Use <HM>`update`</HM> method to notify changes after run a set of instructions:

```dart showLineNumbers=false
userSignal.update((user) {
  user.firstname = "Firstname";
  user.lastname = "Lastname";
});
```

Use <HM>`refresh`</HM> method to force to notify changes.

```dart showLineNumbers=false
userSignal.refresh();
```

### Listening to changes

<MDXRedry mdx={ListeningChangesHook} vars={{
  hookName: 'Signal',
  hookVariable: 'mySignal',
}}/>

:::note[With Flutter]
<HT>[`ReactterWatcher`](/reactter/widgets/reactter_watcher)</HT> is a way to keep the widgets automatically updates, accessing the `value` of <HT>`Signal`</HT> reactively.
