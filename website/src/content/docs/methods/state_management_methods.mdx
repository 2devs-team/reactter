:::tip
This documentation assumes you've already read the [State Management](/reactter/core_concepts/state_management).
It's recommended read that first if you're new in Reactter.

Reactter provides several methods to manage states in a more efficient way. These methods are used to create and manipulate states in a more organized way.

## <HM>`Reactter.lazyState`</HM>

<HM>`Reactter.lazyState`</HM> is a method that allows to create a state lazily in a dependency(class registered via the [dependency injection](/reactter/core_concepts/dependency_injection)).
It's useful when you want to create a state that depends on other states or variables.

<HM>`Reactter.lazyState`</HM> is generally used in states declared with the <HK>`late`</HK> keyword.

### Syntax

```dart
T Reactter.lazyState<T extends ReactterState>(T stateFn(), Object instance);
```

### Example

For example, you can create a state lazily in a class like this:

```dart title="counter_controller.dart" "Reactter.lazyState" "UseState"
import "package:reactter/reactter.dart";

class CountController {
  final int initialCount;

  late final uCount = Reactter.lazyState(
    () => UseState(this.initialCount),
    this,
  );

  CountController([this.initialCount = 0]) {
    UseEffect(() {
      print("Count: ${uCount.value}");
    }, [uCount]);
  }
}
```
and then use it like this:

```dart title="main.dart" "Reactter.create" "Reactter.delete"
import "./counter_controller.dart";

void main() {
  final controller = Reactter.create(() => CounterController(10));
  controller.uCount.value += 2; // Count: 12
  Reactter.delete<CounterController>();
  controller.uCount.value += 3; // Error: "Can't update when it's been disposed"
}
```

In the example, the `uCount` state is lazily declared inside the <HT>`CountController`</HT> class using <HM>Reactter.lazyState</HM>. It's accessed after creating the <HT>`CountController`</HT> instance, and when the instance is deleted, the state is automatically disposed, ensuring efficient resource management.
