State management is fundamental to applications, as it determines how information is stored, updated and shared within the application.
Flutter provides `StafulWidgets` to manage local state, which is usually sufficient for small applications,
However, as the application grows, state management becomes more complex and difficult to maintain.
This is why there are several packages to manage global state.

Although state management is a key component of an application architecture, it is not the only factor to consider.
Dependency injection, event handling, and, in the case of Flutter applications, proper rendering control,
are equally crucial to ensure that the application is scalable, flexible and easy to maintain in the long term.
All these aspects must be considered together to create a robust and efficient architecture.

While numerous state management packages exist, many of them do not offer complete or robust enough solutions.
This challenge is further intensified in Dart-only applications, where the lack of adequate options for global state management makes management even more challenging.

With this in mind, **Reactter** was created—a **_light_**, **_powerful_** and **_reactive_** [**state management**](/reactter/en/core_concepts/state_management), [**dependency injection**](/reactter/en/core_concepts/dependency_injection) and [**event_handler**](/reactter/en/core_concepts/event_handler) package for Dart/Flutter.

## Motivation

**Reactter** was born as an experiment in developing a new way to manage state in Flutter projects that was efficient, reactive, scalable, yet simple and easy to use.

Inspired by ReactJS, Reactter(**Reac**t-Fu**tter**) adopts key concepts from this library to Dart and Flutter, offering a streamlined solution consistent with the needs of development modern.
