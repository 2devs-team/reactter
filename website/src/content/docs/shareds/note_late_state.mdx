title: Late State
vars:
  stateName: RtState
  exampleCode: 'example code'

import { HK, HM, HT } from '@/components/Highlight';

:::note
In some cases, you may need to declare a state variable that will be initialized later. For this, you can use the <HK>`late`</HK> keyword.
When using <HT>`[[stateName]]`</HT> as <HK>`late`</HK> within a dependency(class registered via the [dependency injection](/reactter/core_concepts/dependency_injection)), use <HM>`Rt.lazyState`</HM> (Learn more about [Lazy state binding](/reactter/extra_topics/binding_state_to_dependency/#lazy-state-binding)). e.g:
[[exampleCode]]
