title: Late State
vars:
  stateName: ReactterState
  exampleCode: 'example code'

import { HK, HM, HT } from '@/components/Highlight';

:::note
In some cases, you may need to declare a state variable that will be initialized later. For this, you can use the <HK>`late`</HK> keyword.
When using <HT>`[[stateName]]`</HT> as <HK>`late`</HK> within a class registered via the [dependency injection](/reactter/core_concepts/dependency_injection), use <HM>`Reactter.lazyState`</HM>.
Learn more about it [here](/reactter/methods/to_manage_state/lazy_state). e.g:

[[exampleCode]]
