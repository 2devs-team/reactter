import { HE, HM, HT } from '@/components/Highlight/index.ts';

When `value` has changed, the <HT>`[[hookName]]`</HT> will emit the following events(learn about it [here](/reactter/core_concepts/lifecycle/)):

- <HE>`Lifecycle.willUpdate`</HE> event is triggered before the `value` change or <HM>`update`</HM>, <HM>`refresh`</HM> methods have been invoked.
- <HE>`Lifecycle.didUpdate`</HE> event is triggered after the `value` change or <HM>`update`</HM>, <HM>`refresh`</HM>  methods have been invoked.

Example of listening to changes:

```dart "Reactter.on" "Lifecycle.didUpdate" 
Reactter.on(
  [[hookVariable]],
  Lifecycle.didUpdate,
  (_, state) => print("State value has changed to: ${state.value}"),
);
```
