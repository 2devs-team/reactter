import { HE, HM, HT } from '@/components/Highlight';

When `value` has changed, the <HT>`[[stateName]]`</HT> will emit the following events(learn about it [here](/reactter/core_concepts/lifecycle/)):

- <HE>`Lifecycle.willUpdate`</HE> event is triggered before the change in `value` or <HM>`update`</HM> method have been invoked.
- <HE>`Lifecycle.didUpdate`</HE> event is triggered after the change in `value` or after <HM>`update`</HM> or <HM>`notify`</HM> methods have been invoked.

Example of listening to changes:

```dart "Rt.on" "Lifecycle.didUpdate"
Rt.on(
  [[stateVariable]],
  Lifecycle.didUpdate,
  (_, state) => print("State value has changed to: ${state.value}"),
);
```
