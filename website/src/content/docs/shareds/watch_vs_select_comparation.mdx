  <summary>Show me an example and explanation</summary>

  ```dart showLineNumbers=false "context.watch" "context.select"
  [...]
  build(BuildContext context) {
    final product = context.watch<Product>(
      (product) => [product.price, product.quantity],
    );
    final total = product.price.value + product.quantity.value;

    return Text("Total: $total");
  }

  // is equivalent to

  [...]
  build(BuildContext context) {
    final total = context.select<Product>(
      (product, $) {
        // The `$(...)` syntax is used to select a specific state to listen for changes.
        return $(product.price).value + $(product.quantity).value;
      },
    );

    return Text("Total: $total");
  }
  ```

  In the example above, we use <HT>`context.watch`</HT> and <HT>`context.select`</HT> to calculate the `total` price of a `product` based on its unit `price` and `quantity`.
  These methods update the UI when certain dependencies change, but they have different performance implications.

  When using <HT>`context.watch`</HT>, the widget will rebuild whenever any of the dependencies change, even if the change in state does not affect the calculated value.
  This can lead to unnecessary rebuilds and reduced performance.

  In contrast, <HT>`context.select`</HT> allows you to listen for specific state changes and only rebuilds when the calculated value (`total`) changes.
  This approach is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary rebuilds, leading to better performance.
